### Game story summary, focusing on gameplay
You're the commander of the Vigilant, one of Earth's last battleships, charged with leading and protecting an evacuation fleet as they venture towards E2-C223 to begin civilization anew.  As the fleet of ships jump from point to point through space, you are attacked!  In the chaos, the individual captains of each transport ship scatter without regard for the rest of the fleet and flee through space using unique escape vectors.  Your mission still stands, though amended .. Find the missing transport ships and lead them to their new  home!

### Distinct modes of gameplay
As the commander of the Vigilant, the player must search the surrounding star systems to locate the missing civilian transports and lead them to their new home planet.  The player must manipulate the game board such that there are three or more adjacent tiles (horizontal or vertical) with matching icons.  In doing so, the player boosts the ship system indicated by the icon depending on which ship's view is active.

For example, three or more adjacent "scanner" tiles while the Tactical view is active will boost the weapons targeting speed.  While the Astrometrics view is active, the same set of "scanner" tiles could reveal nearby systems to travel to.

In another example, three or more adjacent "engine" tiles while the Navigation view is active will boost the ready state of the ship's engines.  While the Engineering view is active, the same set of adjacent "engine" tiles will boost the engine's ready state at a slightly greater rate.

The "repair" tile is view independent.  Three or more adjacent "repair" tiles will repair all systems with the active system receiving half of the total repair amount. 

### Unique selling points
This game is the intersection where Candy Crush meets Faster Than Light meets that one episode of Battlestar Galactica (where the civilian fleet got separated from Galactica due to jump coordinate miscalculation).
- Match 3+ adjacent tiles to charge and repair ship systems
- Tile matching rewards depend on which ship's view is currently active
- As the commander of the Vigilant, the player decides whether to stay and fight or to ready engines to jump to short-lived safety
- Randomly selected/generated star maps to explore
